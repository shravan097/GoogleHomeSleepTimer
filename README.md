# GoogleHomeSleepTimer
I always used a sleep timer calculation but I was lazy to always check on my phone and go to sleepyti.me and set and alarm. Why not use Google Home and use the voice control.  In this project, I used DialogFlow for NLP and ML. DiaglogFlow did all the hardwork for NLP and ML. I just had to write few node.js code to get it working.

## Things you an say ( CURRENTLY TESTING ) 
You can say: 
-  __( *What time should I wake up ?* )__

  - *"Sure! Here is the Test Version of Sleep Timer"*

- *"Good time to wake up tomorrow would be 6:02 or 7:32"*

**Note that time is in 24 HR format. **
